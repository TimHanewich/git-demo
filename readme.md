# Git Demo
This repository is designed to demo basic functionality of git as a version control system.

## Some commands
- `git status` - Which files in this directory have been changed since the last commit?
- `git diff` - Specifically, what changed in those files since the last commit?
- `git add` - Add a file's changes to the staging area (prepare for a commit)
- `git commit` - Commit the staged changes to the change log (git)
